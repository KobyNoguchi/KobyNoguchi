Hi I'm a security researcher who specializes in web application penetration testing. 
I've uploaded some tools I've made with mostly python and some javascript to help with ethical web application penetration testing.
I'm actively looking for a job in the offensive information security field. 
I have a SYO-501 CompTIA Security+ along with a Bachelors in Management Information Systems & Business Management.

Best,
Koby
